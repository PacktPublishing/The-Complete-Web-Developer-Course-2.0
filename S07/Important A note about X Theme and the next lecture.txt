Important: A note about X Theme and the next lecture
Section 7, Lecture 177
Since the recording of the next video lecture there has been a slight change to the X Theme settings due to updates.

The Cornerstone plugin mentioned is installed by default.
Portfolio and blog don’t show by default as per course the next video. To get extra pages to show on the menu go to Appearance > Customise > Menus - Under the X Demo Menu click ‘add items’ to add extra pages.
