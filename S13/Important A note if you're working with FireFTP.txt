Important: A note if you're working with FireFTP
Section 13, Lecture 286
Some students have reported receiving the error ‘No such file or directory: exec failed (helloworld.py)’ on the next project. This looks to be caused if you're work on a Windows computer and use FireFTP to create the python scripts as the file is being saved with a Windows carriage returns (the instruction to the software to start a new line) and will not be parsed correctly on the web servers.

Copying over the exact same code but creating through the File Manager, or Brackets and uploading it to the webspace will to resolve this.
